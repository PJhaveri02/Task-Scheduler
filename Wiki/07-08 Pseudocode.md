Progress on the 7th of August
Attendence: Kenny, Wong, Josh

- Started making interfaces for classes we expect to us.

- Created an algorithm interface so we can extend it to make a 'bad' algorithm to meet milestone 1's criteria.

- Created a task class with some expected field values. Used a map to map out the dependencies of the task as well as the edge weight of the task.

- Created a processor class. This is so we can easily allocate tasks in the processor.

- Added pseudocode to BadAlgorithm method
