# project-1-4-the-oopsies
Progress on the 7th of August

Attendence: Kenny, Wong, Josh

Started on making some interfaces for classes we expect to us.

Created an algorithm interface so we can extend it to make a 'bad' algorithm to meet milestone 1's criteria.

Created a task class with some expected field values. Used a map to map out the dependencies of the task as well as the edge weight of the task.

Created an empty processor class. This is so we can easily allocate tasks in the processor.
